# How I get to Obsidian

## How this journey starts

It was one of the random day that I decided to go to our newly opened office in Tokyo Square Garden. Then I met Roy who was working for Synqa the first time this 2020. He introduced me to [[roam research]] which was a nice note taking web application! He demonstrated back-link feature and his graph of roam research. He also showed how he would connect his kindle highlight to roam automatically with Readwise.

So that is how I start this knowledge note taking journey!

## Roam Research

So I started with roam research. It was a good web application. And as Roy promised me, it was sticky. I love how I start to log my daily journey and have the habit to take notes on random stuffs. The UI was also great and intuitive to use. The Todo list function was also super awesome! You can randomly add a todo and then it will show up in same page where you can go and tick that as done!

As I liked Roam research that much, I started to dig into this rabbit hole and see what else is in there for similar use?

## Welcome....Obsidian

Then I found Obsidian! To be honest, I was not convinced to swap at the very beginning. First thing that bothers me is to sync between devices. I would like my note to auto sync between two of my macs.

Aside from that, the UI/UX was not as intuitive as roam research:
1. It does not have the automated back link blocks showing in the same page of the doc.
2. It does not have the nice todo page that can auto back link all the todo blocks scattered in different files and will be able to click the todos as done from that page
3. Markdown despite is a nice format, it requires split view to edit it nicely (at least for me).

But to be fair, there are several features that catches my eyeball immediately:
1. Presentation mode! This is quite a unique feature.
2. Markdown. Yes, despite there are some down sides, but markdown file is more ready to be published or shared with others as doc.
3. Price: free! (disclaimer: there are paid plan)


Given that I see the benefit of obsidian, I invested some time and I get to a setup that I am happy with my Obsidian now : )

## My Obsidian setup
The following would be some breakdowns of some features or workflows on my obsidian

#### Todo pages
I have one todo page for life and one for working notes. I use the trick of `![[todo]]` to put preview of todo page into my daily notes. So I can get reminded of all the todos whenever i am in my daily note page.

#### Daily page
This is my day to day note gathering page and something I would open usually.
I have one section to random notes for life and one for work. I will link whatever zettelkasten notes I have that day to here (also, my zettelkasten template auto insert the link of daily note too!).

#### Zettelkasten Note
This is one feature I like about obsidian. It allows atomic idea pages easily. Usually I would put the topic of the note after the zettelkasten id (I am using the default one). So I can ensure its uniqueness and still make it easy to trace what that note is by title.

I put random notes using this. It can be a article note, random shower idea, something I learned from some software....etc.

#### Structured folders
I do still have a little bit of structure on my folders. And if I got some topics specific I am doing intensively, I will put them in the same folder. For instance, I am practicing leetcode, and I put all my notes under `notes/leedcode/`.

I also have a `incubator/` folder that is holding some writings I would like to publish (like this one!).

## How has obsidian or roam research changed me?
One thing that is important to me is I start to note things down a lot much more. Previously I was only using `Notes` app from the Mac and iOS. I usually only use that as a temporary place I would like to hold something.

However, this new way of noting allows you to just put it down randomly without being well structured. And thus it decreases the mental barrier to put note down. With note inside obsidian, you are motivated to write something to connect things or publish ideas to others.

## Obsidian alternatives
From the research that I have done, I know a few other note taking application with similar features:
1. roam research: https://roamresearch.com
2. foam (based on VScode extension): https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
3. remnote: https://www.remnote.io
